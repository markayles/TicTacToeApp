### Purpose of This Project
Just for the sake of creating something. 

### Future Plans
- Modify the AI opponent to actually be smart-ish instead of choosing at random.
- Dynamically draw the grid instead of the hard coded writelines.
- Add console colors to easily distinguish between the different players spots on the board. Also a different color to identify the last placed spot.
- Refactor GameLogic in the TicTacToeLibrary to extract the data out instead of being static. Lack of planning on that part lead to the several static variables.
- Potentially more...
